The solution involves using strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality. This prevents PHP from performing type juggling and ensures that the comparison is accurate.  Here's the corrected code:
```php
<?php
$stringZero = '0';
$booleanFalse = false;

if ($stringZero === $booleanFalse) {
    echo "String '0' is equal to false (strict comparison)";
} else {
    echo "String '0' is NOT equal to false (strict comparison)";
}
?>
```This code will correctly output:  'String '0' is NOT equal to false (strict comparison)'.
